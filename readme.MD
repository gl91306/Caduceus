## Inspiration

We saw that most of the patients forget to take the medicine/injection/doses on time.

## What it does

We made a web app in less than 24 hours which helps to give a reminder to all the patients about the medicine/injection/doses.

## How we built it

We built it using Flask ( a python web framework) for the Backend and HTML,CSS, JS for the front-end.

## Challenges we ran into

This hack was more challenging than expected. We struggled in building the backend and connecting it to the database.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We proud that we successfully ran the server which was not running and we made the calendar show up in our website

## What we learned

We learnt using Flask and how to connect backend with a database and a front end to back-end

## What's next for Remedical 

We are looking forward to expand this to all domain not only in medicine but also work life and many more are coming

## How to run:

install python and type python -m SimpleHTTPServer and thats it :)
